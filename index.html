    <h1>The Bear and The Bunny</h1>
    <img src="bear-bunny.png" alt="bear and bunny holding fruits">
    <p>Once upon a time, in a lush forest filled with tall trees and babbling brooks, there lived a bear named Bert.
        Bert was a large, friendly bear with shaggy brown fur and a big, fluffy tail. He loved nothing more than
        wandering through the forest, breathing in the fresh pine scent, and eating juicy, ripe strawberries.</p>
    <p>One day, while out for a walk, Bert came across a little bunny named Bella. Bella was a cute and curious bunny,
        with soft, white fur and big, floppy ears. Unlike Bert, Bella loved bananas. She would often be seen munching on
        a bunch of them, sitting under the warm sun, enjoying the taste of the sweet, yellow fruit.</p>
    <p>As they met for the first time, Bert and Bella were both surprised. They had never seen each other before in the
        forest and they were both amazed by the other's love of their favourite fruit. They started talking, and as they
        did, they soon realized that they had much in common. They both loved the forest, and the simple pleasures of
        life. And as they spent more and more time together, they began to realize that they were falling in love.</p>
    <p>They would go on long walks together and would share their fruits, Bert would give Bella a strawberry, and she
        would return the favour with a banana. They would laugh and play together, and before they knew it, they were
        inseparable.</p>
    <p>As time passed, Bert and Bella's love for each other grew stronger and stronger. They knew that they were meant
        to be together and they decided to make it official. They had a beautiful ceremony in the forest, surrounded by
        all of their animal friends, and they exchanged vows under the bright, shining stars.</p>
    <p>From that day on, Bert and Bella were known as the happiest couple in the forest. They lived together in a cozy
        little cave, and they would spend their days exploring the forest, sharing their fruits and enjoying each
        other's company. And at night, as they drifted off to sleep, they would snuggle up close together, knowing that
        they were truly blessed to have found their one true love.</p>

    <p>As Bert and Bella settled into their life together, they began to dream of starting a family. They talked about
        it often and finally, after a year of marriage, they were
    <p>As Bert and Bella settled into their life together, they began to dream of starting a family. They talked about
        it often and finally, after a year of marriage, they were blessed with two children, a baby elephant named
        Stacks and a baby hippo named Hymn.</p>
    <p>Stacks was a curious and adventurous little elephant, who loved to explore the forest just like his father. He
        would often be seen trailing behind Bert, trying to keep up with his big, strong steps. Hymn, on the other hand,
        was a more laid-back hippo, who loved nothing more than lounging in the cool waters of the nearby stream, just
        like her mother.</p>
    <p>As the years passed, Stacks and Hymn grew bigger and stronger. They both inherited their parents' love for
        fruits, and would often be seen sampling strawberries and bananas together. They were the best of friends and
        would often be found playing together in the forest.</p>
    <p>One day, while out for a walk, Stacks and Hymn stumbled upon a large patch of strawberries and bananas. They were
        overjoyed to find such a bountiful supply of their favourite fruits, and they knew that they had to share this
        discovery with their parents.</p>
    <p>When they returned to their cave, they were greeted with open arms by Bert and Bella. They were thrilled to hear
        about the patch of fruits and they decided to make it a family tradition to visit it every year.</p>
    <p>So every summer, the family would pack a picnic and head out to the fruit patch, where they would spend the day
        eating, laughing and playing together. It became their favourite annual tradition, one that they all looked
        forward to.</p>
    <p>As the years passed, Bert and Bella watched their children grow into strong, kind and responsible adults, who
        still loved and respected each other as much as the day they were born. They were proud of the family they had
        created together and were grateful for the love and happiness that they shared.</p>
    <p>And so, the bear and the bunny, who fell in love over strawberries and bananas, lived happily ever after with
        their two children, Stacks the Elephant, and Hymn the Hippo.</p>
